# AbaqusLayerAnalysis
This python script extracts laminar volume and thickness information from 2D multi-layered simulations of brain folding. This work was inspired by Siegfried Thomas Bok's 1929 discovery of the cortex's relative volume preservation throughout cortical folding. For the code to successfully run, a valid Abaqus 2022 license is required along with the relevant Python packages (see requirements.txt). A sample output database (odb) file and instructions for how to run the General_Geometric_Thickness_Analysis.py have been provided so that a potential user can test the code before applying it to their own work.
